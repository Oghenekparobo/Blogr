## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com)- for styles


### What I learned
i got familiar with tailwind css and the fact that i can bundle numerous styles in one class, makes it a very powerfultool, different from other css

```tailwind css
 
.btn{ 
    @apply hover:text-red-600 hover:bg-white hover:p-2 hover:px-6 hover:font-bold hover:rounded-full hover:transition hover:duration-100  hover:ease-out;
}

```

### Continued development

the project would be made responsive to all screens subsequently, i will also be refactoring the codes too, active states for nav menus will aslo be completed with javascript
